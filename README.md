# homebrew-tap

Personal Homebrew tap for custom and forked builds.

## How to use

```bash
brew tap yofriadi/tap
brew install yofriadi/tap/pib
brew install yofriadi/tap/opencode-nightly
brew install yofriadi/tap/tree
```

`pib` installs as `pib`.
`opencode-nightly` installs as `ocn` (no conflict with official `opencode`).
